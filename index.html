				Hi! My name is Jana Guan and I am a 3rd year student at UC Berkeley. I major in Cognitive Science and I love it! I get to learn about the human mind through different lens such as Computer Science, Neuroscience, Philosphy, and more-- it's amazing to see just how broad the human mind is! In my spare time, I love designing, doing calligraphy, reading, traveling, and playing volleyball! I hope that you enjoy my projects and I would love to talk-- whether it would be about volleyball, my projects, etc.-- it would nice be able to get to know you!

			For this project, we were asked to create business cards for our careers we would love to pursue if we were given the chance. The first thing that came to mind was a bakery because they always looked so cool in movies! I wanted to give the card a old-fashion, home-made kind of feel and eventually created to this card as I sketched what came to mind in a bakery.

				We were asked to create an abstract art piece that showed a time sequence. Personally, abstract art is a strange concept to me but this project was engaging because the idea of time allowed to be more concrete. Hopefully, someday I can experience all four seasons, not just the two that are in California.
