				Hi there! I'm Jana, a junior at Cal studying Cognitive Science and I am interested in visual and product design. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, doing calligraphy, playing volleyball, reading, and going to cafes I haven't been to before. I hope that you enjoy my projects and I would love to talk-- whether it would be about volleyball, my projects, etc.-- it would nice be able to get to know you!

			The mess of flour across the table and the array of sugar, chocolate chips, and butter only mean one thing: desserts. I wanted to give off a familiar vibe of baking at home as I worked on this project. Plus, it's always been a dream of mine to open up my own bakery!

				Life always has stories to tell. Even during the periods of life where each day seems the same. Our professor challenged us to look beyond the tasks we need to get done and enjoy the blessings we have in life. In every season, in every joy and sorrow, there's always something to be thankful for.
