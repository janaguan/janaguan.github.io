				<p> Hi! My name is Jana Guan and I am a 3rd year student at UC Berkeley. I major in Cognitive Science and I love it! I get to learn about the human mind through different lens such as Computer Science, Neuroscience, Philosphy, and more-- it's amazing to see just how broad the human mind is! In my spare time, I love designing, doing calligraphy, reading, traveling, and playing volleyball! I hope that you enjoy my projects and I would love to talk-- whether it would be about volleyball, my projects, etc.-- it would nice be able to get to know you! </p>
